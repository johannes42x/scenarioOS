# MetaMemoryWorks Restricted License (MMW-RL) v1.0

**Author:** Johannes Glaser  
**Contact:** licensing@metamemoryworks.com / lizenz@metamemoryworks.de  
**Year:** 2025

---

## 0. Purpose

The MetaMemoryWorks Restricted License (MMW-RL) governs the use, modification,
distribution, reimplementation, and integration of all MetaMemoryWorks modules,
architectures, specifications, file bundles, engines, **documented methods and
materials derived therefrom**, schemas, templates, presets, and derivative works —
whether distributed as text, JSON, YAML, Markdown, code, documentation, or
reconstructed through interaction with a large language model (LLM), **as
described in the accompanying documentation and specifications**.

The license protects **both the documented method and the associated product
materials**.

Licensing obligations **apply regardless of format, medium, model, runtime,
transformation, or reimplementation technique**.


---

## 1. Allowed Uses (Free, Non-Commercial, Individual Only)

The following uses are permitted **without charge**:

- strictly personal, private, non-commercial use by individuals;
- individual, self-directed learning and experimentation conducted **outside of any institutional, organizational, supervised, or funded research context**;
- private experimentation and modification, provided such use **does not contribute to, support, or anticipate any commercial, institutional, or organizational activity**.

These permissions apply regardless of file format, runtime, storage backend,
or model provider.

No attribution is required for private individual use.

---

## 2. Uses for Which No License Is Granted

No license is granted for the following uses:

- military organizations, military research, defense contractors, dual-use development, or weapons systems;
- intelligence agencies, surveillance operations, population-monitoring, or mass profiling systems;
- law-enforcement predictive analytics, profiling, or coercive control systems;
- psychological manipulation, behavioral influence, persuasion systems, or exploitative applications;
- harmful, abusive, or rights-violating applications;
- medical or legal decision-making systems without certified professional oversight;
- research, development, or operational use involving, supporting, or conducted in connection with animal experimentation or animal testing;
- systems intended to deceive, exploit, or manipulate individuals or populations.

These restrictions apply regardless of whether the method is used directly,
reimplemented, rewritten, or reconstructed through interaction with a large
language model (LLM), and apply equally to all uses described in Section 1.

---

## 3. Commercial and Institutional Use (License Required)

Any of the following uses require **explicit written permission** and a
**commercial licensing agreement**:

- corporate, governmental, organizational, or NGO use;
- integration into paid products or services;
- internal use within companies or institutions, whether or not publicly deployed;
- embedding MetaMemoryWorks architectures into LLM agents, APIs, pipelines, or automation systems;
- commercial consulting, training, or data-analysis workflows;
- **all institutional academic research**, including but not limited to:
  - university projects;
  - supervised research;
  - PhD, PostDoc, or faculty research;
  - laboratory or consortium research;
  - grant-funded or sponsored research;
  - research contributing to institutional outputs or publications.

Absence of payment does **not** imply non-commercial status.  
Any use by an institution or organization is considered commercial by default.

For the avoidance of doubt, a commercial license is **not required** for
non-commercial, non-operational academic research conducted by established
research institutions or departments, **provided that** such research:

- does not fall under any of the prohibited uses listed in Section 2;
- does not involve deployment in production systems, services, APIs, or user-facing platforms;
- does not involve behavioral influence, surveillance, profiling, or automated decision-making systems;
- does not contribute to commercial products, services, or operational decision-making within an institution;
- is conducted primarily for purposes of analysis, evaluation, critique, replication, or scholarly publication.

Any research exceeding these conditions requires a commercial license.

## 4. Method and Architecture Protection

This license protects **both**:

1. **The documented method** — including the Represent → Assign → Persist → Use cycle,
   memory semantics, architectural expectations, and behavioral structures as
   described in the MetaMemoryWorks documentation and specifications;
2. **The product materials** — any files, templates, schemas, logs, engines, or
   bundles distributed as part of MetaMemoryWorks.

Rewriting, reformatting, renaming, fragmenting, or reimplementing the documented
method, in whole or in part, **does not remove licensing obligations** where the
resulting system is **derived from, based on, or functionally equivalent to**
the documented method or architecture.

Implementations that are demonstrably derived from the MetaMemoryWorks
documentation, specifications, or method descriptions remain subject to this
license, **regardless of differences in terminology, structure, or implementation
details**.

---

## 5. Functional Equivalence Clause

A system is considered a **derivative implementation** if, based on a
reasonable technical assessment, it reproduces, implements, or reconstructs
any of the **architectural patterns documented by MetaMemoryWorks**, in whole
or in part, including but not limited to:

- persistent external memory structures with defined semantic roles;
- append-only or history-preserving state management used to influence system behavior;
- multi-file or multi-location assignment of representations with explicit structural expectations;
- mechanisms that guide or constrain LLM behavior through externalized state;
- file-driven or schema-driven normalization of memory and context;
- reconstruction of the Represent → Assign → Persist → Use cycle as described in the documentation;
- engines, workflows, or methods that induce **functionally equivalent behavior**
  through comparable architectural means.

Differences in naming, formatting, terminology, or conceptual framing do not
alter this assessment where the underlying architecture and method remain
substantially equivalent.

---

## 6. Format / Media / Model / Runtime Shift Clause

Licensing obligations persist under all transformations of the documented
method or derived implementations, including but not limited to:

- file format changes (JSON ↔ YAML ↔ databases ↔ Markdown, etc.);
- media or storage changes (local files, cloud storage, vector stores, embedded memory);
- summarization, rewriting, compression, or re-expression by LLMs;
- model substitutions (different LLM providers, custom models, hybrid systems);
- runtime or platform changes (interpreted, compiled, or cloud-based systems);
- refactoring, restructuring, or modular reorganization of engines or workflows.

No such transformation nullifies the applicability of this license to
implementations derived from the documented method.

---

## 7. Anti-Evasion Clause

The following actions do **not** constitute independent implementations and
do **not** exempt a system from this license where the resulting system is
derived from or functionally equivalent to the documented method:

- renaming, relocating, or reorganizing files or components;
- altering field names, schemas, or storage strategies without material architectural change;
- splitting, merging, or reorganizing modules;
- rewriting an implementation from scratch while preserving the documented architecture;
- substituting terminology (e.g., "log", "notebook", "memory", "state");
- reconstructing the method through interaction with a large language model;
- replacing storage backends (e.g., embeddings, vector stores, graph databases);
- simulating or approximating the documented behavior through equivalent architectural means.

A system is considered a derivative implementation where its architecture and
behavior can be reasonably shown to be derived from, based on, or functionally
equivalent to the MetaMemoryWorks documented method, regardless of superficial
implementation differences.


---

## 8. Redistribution

Redistribution of MetaMemoryWorks materials in **unaltered form** is permitted
for non-commercial purposes, provided that:

- this license remains attached; and
- attribution to MetaMemoryWorks is preserved.

Modification of MetaMemoryWorks materials is permitted **only for private,
non-commercial individual use** and may **not** be redistributed in modified
form without an appropriate license.

Any commercial redistribution, whether modified or unmodified, requires a
commercial license.

---

## 9. Warranty, Liability, and Safety

MetaMemoryWorks is provided **as-is**, without warranty of any kind, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law. No guarantee is made regarding
accuracy, safety, or fitness for any particular purpose. Users assume full
responsibility for all outcomes resulting from use of the materials.

MetaMemoryWorks is **not** a medical, legal, psychological, or financial
authority. Critical decisions require certified professional oversight.

---

## 10. Termination

Any unlicensed commercial use or prohibited use immediately terminates all
rights granted under this license. Upon termination, all use, modification,
and distribution must cease.

Termination does not reinstate rights unless explicitly granted in writing.

---

## 11. Jurisdiction

For private, non-commercial use, governing law defaults to the user's place of
residence unless otherwise required by applicable law. Commercial licenses may
specify a different governing law and jurisdiction.
