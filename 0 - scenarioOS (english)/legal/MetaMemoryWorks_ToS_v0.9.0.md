## 1. Nature of MMW
MMW is a modular informational and creative software architecture designed to operate within ChatGPT or compatible AI systems.
MMW provides memory structures, templates, workflows, training plans, simulations, and guidance logic.

All decisions and actions based on MMW remain solely the user’s responsibility.

## 2. Platform Dependency
MMW operates on top of third-party AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT). 
AI output may change over time, depend on model updates, or behave unpredictably.

MMW has no control over:
- model behavior, hallucinations, or errors,
- latency, availability, or uptime of the host platform,
